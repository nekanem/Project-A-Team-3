# Project-A-Team-3

##### VCU, Spring 2020, CMSC 355: Software Engineer: Spec and Des.


## Project A:
Programming is hard but with practice, anyone can learn it. Novice programmers need consistent practice reading code and hand tracing       through code to understand how variables change, learn syntax, and develop problem-solving skills. This app uses daily mini-lessons to     help beginning programming students develop a regular programming practice.


## Functional requirements:
* Students create an account with a password to log into the application.
* Each registered student’s progress is stored.
* Students are given five daily mini-lessons each that can be completed in 5 - 10 minutes but must be completed on the day assigned.
* On the sixth day, a short 5 - 10 question quiz is given on the topics from the previous 5 lessons.
* On the seventh day, a record of all students who completed all 6 days is sent to the course instructor.
* If desired, a student can have a record of their progress sent to them via email.


## Questions for the Project:
1. Are students able to view their progress as time goes by?
2. Can students repeat lessons for reviewing?
3. Is there a limit on how many times a student can attempt a required task?
4. Is there a limit on how many times a student can take the quiz/lessons?
5. Are hints allowed on quizzes?  //maybe keep this a secret unique to ours
6. Does the instructor state when the start of a 6-day class is or it’s when a student starts the lesson? In other words, are the daily lessons assigned from a specific date to 6 days from there or it is 6 days from when the student starts the first lesson?
7. Is any part of the daily lessons graded? Or is it all just for completion?
8. Are hints allowed in the daily lessons? Can students view the answer if they give up?
9. Are we allowed to use any supportive framework or do we have to code from scratch?
10. What happened if they don’t finish yesterday’s work? Will it add up to today’s work?
11. What happens if the student creates an account, not doing any of the assignments for 6 days straight, will he still be given the quiz? or does he need to complete all the lessons first?
