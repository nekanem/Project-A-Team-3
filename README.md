# Project-A-Team-3

##### VCU, Spring 2020, CMSC 355: Software Engineer: Spec and Des.


## Project A:
Programming is hard but with practice, anyone can learn it. Novice programmers need consistent practice reading code and hand tracing       through code to understand how variables change, learn syntax, and develop problem-solving skills. This app uses daily mini-lessons to     help beginning programming students develop a regular programming practice.


## Functional requirements:
* Students create an account with a password to log into the application.
* Each registered student’s progress is stored.
* Students are given five daily mini-lessons each that can be completed in 5 - 10 minutes but must be completed on the day assigned.
* On the sixth day, a short 5 - 10 question quiz is given on the topics from the previous 5 lessons.
* On the seventh day, a record of all students who completed all 6 days is sent to the course instructor.
* If desired, a student can have a record of their progress sent to them via email.


## Questions for the Project:
1. What are the requirments for signing up? Does a student have to be part of a class with an instructor? Do students get added by the instructor and then they sign up or students sign up and are automatically added to a instructor? Is a free for practice version allowed for students who do not belong to a class?

None at this moment.


## Already asked:
7. Is any part of the daily lessons graded? Or is it all just for completion?
8. Are hints allowed in the daily lessons? Can students view the answer if they give up?
1. How much experience with programming does the user require for this application?
2. How advanced/in-depth should the tutorials get?
4. Is there a limit on how many times a student can take the quiz/lessons?
10. What happened if they don’t finish yesterday’s work? Will it add up to today’s work?

1. Following up on our question from yesterday "What happens if a student doesn't finish yesterday’s work? Will it be added up to today’s work? If yes will there be any point deductions?"
So, just to be clear, if a student does not finish the tasks from yesterday, they will be allowed to do the assignments for the next day, and they are required to do todays assignment before finishing their past due assignments, right? 

2. Another question related to our previous question, if a student has past due assignments from a day, two days, or more, would they be allowed to take the quiz on the 6th day? If yes, are they supposed to take the quiz before finishing their assignments?

3. Does the instructor have the ability to extend due dates? Are the due dates assigned by the instructor or they are generated automatically when a student signs in to the app for the first time? For example if student A downloads the app and signs up on Sunday, they start their 6 day training from then, or the instructor will say, you must finish the 6 day training by the end of some date?

12. Do you want to have separate student mode and instructor mode where the instructor can see all the student's progress live? Or do you want it fixed on the student mode/view only?
13. How's detailed the progress of the student need to be? Do you want to see all the hints the student use, etc?
