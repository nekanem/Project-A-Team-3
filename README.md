# Project-A-Team-3

##### VCU, Spring 2020, CMSC 355: Software Engineer: Spec and Des.


## Project A:
Programming is hard but with practice, anyone can learn it. Novice programmers need consistent practice reading code and hand tracing       through code to understand how variables change, learn syntax, and develop problem-solving skills. This app uses daily mini-lessons to     help beginning programming students develop a regular programming practice.


## Functional requirements:
* Students create an account with a password to log into the application.
* Each registered student’s progress is stored.
* Students are given five daily mini-lessons each that can be completed in 5 - 10 minutes but must be completed on the day assigned.
* On the sixth day, a short 5 - 10 question quiz is given on the topics from the previous 5 lessons.
* On the seventh day, a record of all students who completed all 6 days is sent to the course instructor.
* If desired, a student can have a record of their progress sent to them via email.


## Questions for the Project:
6. Does the instructor state when the start of a 6-day class is or it’s when a student starts the lesson? In other words, are the daily lessons assigned from a specific date to 6 days from there or it is 6 days from when the student starts the first lesson?
7. Is any part of the daily lessons graded? Or is it all just for completion?
8. Are hints allowed in the daily lessons? Can students view the answer if they give up?
11. What happens if the student creates an account, not doing any of the assignments for 6 days straight, will he still be given the quiz? or does he need to complete all the lessons first?
12. Do you want to have separate student mode and instructor mode where the instructor can see all the student's progress live? Or do you want it fixed on the student mode/view only?
13. How's detailed the progress of the student need to be? Do you want to see all the hints the student use, etc?

## Already asked:
1. How much experience with programming does the user require for this application?
2. How advanced/in-depth should the tutorials get?
4. Is there a limit on how many times a student can take the quiz/lessons?
10. What happened if they don’t finish yesterday’s work? Will it add up to today’s work?
