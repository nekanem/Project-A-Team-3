Questions for the project

We need to post 2 questions a day so everyone can come up with something and post here.
Then we can vote on which ones to post.
Please share your ideas if you want to do things differently.


Day1:
  1. Are students able to view their progress as time goes by?
  2. Can students repeat lessons for reviewing?
  3. Is there a limit on how many times a student can attempt a required task?
  4. Is there a limit on how many times a student can take the quiz?
  5. Are hints allowed on quizzes?
  6. Does the instructor state when the start of a 6 day class is or it’s when a student starts the lesson? 
     In other words are the daily lessons assigned from a specific date to 6 days from there or it is 6 days
     from when the student starts the first lesson?
  7.Is any part of the daily lessons graded? Or is it all just for completion?
  8. Are hints allowed in the daily lessons? Can students view the answer if they give up?
